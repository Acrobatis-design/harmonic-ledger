# UST Genesis Ledger

This repository contains the initial specification and reference implementation
for a research-first distributed ledger protocol inspired by Unified Substrate Theory (UST).

The protocol is designed around:
- Causal (non-global) transaction ordering
- Encrypted transaction batching (pre-commit confidentiality)
- Multi-scale authority rotation
- Stability-first (over-damped) congestion control
- Non-custodial, threshold-native security assumptions

## Status

This is an early-stage research and engineering project.
No production network exists yet.
No tokens are live.
No financial promises are made.

## Scope (Phase 0)

- Formal protocol specification
- Genesis allocation constitution
- Minimal reference implementation (testnet-only)
